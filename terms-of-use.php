                            and Location, Guest Details and Cuisine Details. Merchant will review the Inquiry Form

                            finalize the details of the catering order. Payment for the catering services as
                            agreed between Merchant and Customer will be made through the Dishefs app. Merchants
                            will use Merchant-Driver capabilities to deliver catering orders. All terms applying
                            to Merchant-Drivers apply in catering transactions.</li>

                    <p>Merchants may request access to Dine-In Match-Up services, which allow Merchants who offer
                        dine-in services to allow Customers to find and reserve or join wait lists for tables in dine-in
                        restaurants, including pre-ordering and pre-paying for Meals.</p>
                    
                    <p>By electing to use the Dine-In Match-Up Channel, Merchant agrees to accept any applicable
                        addendum.</p>
                    
                    <p>Restaurant Merchants who have dine-in facilities can enroll in the Dine-In Match-Up
                        Channel. Using the Dine-In Match-Up Channel, Customers can view a list of or search
                        available restaurant establishments and request to reserve a table on a specific day at a
                        specific time, or join a wait-list if a reservation is not available. Dine-In Match-Up
                        Restaurant Merchants can approve, reject, or wait-list Match-Up requests based on the
                        availability of tables. Dine-In Match-Up Customers may order from a Restaurant Merchant's
                        menu and pay for their meals through the Dishefs App. Customer payment information will be
                        used to pay for Meals ordered at the Restaurant, at Customer's option, and to cover applicable
                        fees.</p>

                    <p>Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Dishefs and its affiliates will make
                        available the applicable Dishefs Services to Merchant, solely for use by Merchant at locations
                        that are owned and operated by Merchant (each, a "Location"). Merchant shall provide
                        Dishefs current and accurate Location information throughout the Term of this Agreement.
                        In connection with the provision of Dishefs Services to Merchant, Dishefs and its affiliates, on
                        behalf of Merchant, may facilitate resolution of complaints by Merchant's customers
                        ("Customers") about Items or Services sold by Merchant through the Dishefs App. In its
                        sole discretion, Dishefs may refund the fees paid to the consumer if it deems Merchant's
                        suggested response to the dispute unreasonable. In such case, Merchant will remain
                        responsible for the fees it would owe Dishefs had the transaction been fulfilled to the
                        consumer's satisfaction. In addition, Dishefs may make available certain Dishefs Tools to
                        Merchant, and Merchant may access and use those Dishefs Tools solely in connection with
                        Merchant's use of the Dishefs Services. For the avoidance of doubt, as between Merchant
                        and Dishefs, Dishefs will retain sole and absolute control over the Dishefs App (and all
                        elements of the user experience and user interface relating to the Dishefs App), including with
                        respect to: (i) the personalization of the Dishefs App for Customers;(ii) the prioritization and
                        display of options available to Customers; (iii) the search functionality and results provided
                        to Customers; (iv) the order fees charged to Customers for the delivery services provided by
                        Gofers; and (v) adding, removing or otherwise modifying any feature or functionality made
                        available through the Dishefs App to optimize reliability or efficiency on the Dishefs App.</p>

                    <p>The Services include a technology marketplace in which Restaurant Merchants can make available
                        Dine-In reservation services and waitlist services through the Dishefs Dine-In Match-Up, for the
                        purpose of assisting users in securing dining reservations or joining a waitlist at
                        participating Restaurant Merchants. At the time a Customer makes an inquiry about the
                        availability of a Dine-In Match-Up, Restaurant Merchant will have the option of confirming the
                        requested reservation time or notifying the customer that a reservation cannot be made and
                        offering the option to join a wait-list. Customers can then choose to accept the wait-list
                        option, or decline a match-up with Restaurant. Dine-In Match-Up Customers may also choose
                        to order from Restaurant Merchant's menus and make payments through the Dishefs app in
                        advance. Customers will store their payment information to use for restaurant items or
                        other fees. Dine-In Match-Up Customers will agree to allow Restaurant Merchants to charge
                        the stored payment method any agreed-upon No-Show or other fees. The Dine-In Match-Up app
                        has features to send Customers reminders regarding reservation of wait list services, but
                        Restaurant Merchants should also follow up with Customers one (1) to two (2) hours before the
                        scheduled reservation or wait-listing. Restaurant Merchants will have the option of
                        displaying a window sticker or placard notifying Restaurant Customers of the availability of the
                        Dishefs Dine-In Match-Up option.</p>

                    <p>Merchant agrees neither Dishefs nor its affiliates provide any delivery services. Rather, Dishefs
                        provides technology services that both (i) enable Merchant to connect with Customers who may
                        purchase Items from Merchant, and (ii) enable delivery people to seek, receive and fulfill
                        on-demand requests for delivery services by or on behalf of Customers seeking delivery
                        services. Gofers perform their delivery services for (and are paid by) the Customers, and
                        not Merchant. "MerchantDriver," refers to an employee or contracted delivery person of
                        Merchant. "Gofer," refers to independent contractors that intend to seek, receive, and
                        fulfill on-demand requests for delivery services using Dishefs' proprietary technology under
                        license from Dishefs or its affiliates. "Alternate Gofer," may refer to an independent
                        contractor of Dishefs or a Dishefs employee who from time to time provides such delivery
                        services. "3rd Party Driver" refers to a driver contracted with by a third-party service

                        responsible for ensuring that all Items meet the applicable Criteria. If Merchant fails to
                        prepare or supply Items in accordance with Food or Alcohol Safety Standards or if any Item fails
                        to meet the Criteria (each, a "Substandard Item"), Dishefs may, in its sole discretion, remove
                        such Item from the Dishefs App. Items that contain (or may contain) an endangered species may
                        not be made available for purchase through, and will be removed from, the Dishefs App.</p>
                    
                    <p>Merchant represents and warrants that all information for Items (including, but not limited to,
                        calorie count, allergen information, and alcoholic content (if applicable)), that is made
                        available through the Dishefs App or its menu is, and at all times will remain, accurate and

                        Merchant represents and warrants that additional information it may provide to Dishefs regarding
                        Items, whether or not that information is made available to all Customers, such as CO2 waste
                        value, or expiration date is, and at all times will remain accurate. Dishefs acknowledges
                        that it will not use any of the information provided for any purpose other than those
                        contemplated by this agreement.</p>
                    
                    <p>Using the Dine-In Match-Up Channel, Merchant will monitor and respond to inquiries during its
                        normal business hours within one (1) business day of the Inquiry. As described further in
                        the applicable addenda, Merchant will coordinate with Customer to coordinate a Dine-In
                        reservation or wait-listing.</p>
                    
                    <p>Merchant represents and warrants that all information for Items and Services offered through the
                        Match-Up Channel, including available hours, calorie counts, and allergen information, that is
                        made available through the Dishefs App is, and at all times will remain, accurate.

                    <p>Merchant acknowledges and agrees that neither Dishefs nor the Gofer or 3rd Party Driver takes
                        title to any Item at any time. Notwithstanding, Merchant shall be responsible for any
                        reimbursement costs related to Customer refunds for Substandard Items or other related issues
                        within Merchant's control (including any costs associated with retrieving any such Substandard
                        Items or otherwise unsatisfactory Item(s), if applicable)), including by way of example, missing
                        or incomplete Items, Items not cooked thoroughly, and Items not prepared in accordance with
                        Merchant's internal standards. Dishefs may, in its sole discretion, deduct reimbursement costs
                        from the payment Dishefs remits to Merchant in accordance with this Section 4. To the extent
                        required by applicable law, and only for the purpose of the expedited provision of Items, Items
                        are sold to Customers under Merchant's retail and food delivery license privileges or as
                        provided for in any applicable laws and regulations.</p>
                    
                    <p>4.3Devices</p>
                    
                    <p>If Dishefs supplies a tablet or other mobile device ("Device") to Merchant to use in connection
                        with the Dishefs App, Merchant agrees that:</p>
                    
                    <p>a)Device(s) may only be used for the purpose of accepting orders through the Dishefs App,
                        and</p>
                    
                    <p>b)Device(s) may not be transferred, loaned, sold or otherwise provided in any manner to any
                        third party. Devices(s) will at all times remain the property of Dishefs and/or its affiliates,
                        and upon expiration or termination of the Agreement, or the absence of all of Merchant's
                        location(s) from the Dishefs App for longer than forty-five (45) days, Merchant will return all
                        applicable Device(s) to Dishefs within ten (10) days, at Merchant's own cost. If Merchant
                        receives a wireless data plan for the Device, Dishefs may require a weekly reimbursement
                        Merchant for the costs associated with the wireless data plan of each applicable Device.
                        Merchant agrees that the loss or theft of a Device, the failure to timely return a Device, or
                        any damage to a Device outside of normal wear and tear, may result in a fee ("Damage Fee").
                        Merchant agrees that Dishefs may deduct the reimbursement or Damage Fee from the Revenue prior
                        to remittance of such Revenue to Merchant.</p>

                        transactions. There are risks that you assume when dealing with other users (including
                        those who may be acting under false pretenses) and all of these risks are borne by you, and not
                        Dishefs. We encourage you to use the various functionalities of the Service (e.g.,

                        to the goals to be attained and the results to be achieved by Merchants generally, but you shall
                        be solely responsible for the manner and hours in which your services are performed; (ii) you
                        are responsible for and will comply with all applicable laws and registration requirements,
                        including those applicable to independent contractors and maximum working hours regulations;
                        (iii) these Terms do not create an association, joint venture, partnership, franchise, or
                        employer/employee relationship between you and Dishefs, or you and a Customer; (iv) you will not
                        represent yourself as an employee or agent of Dishefs or any Customer; (v) you will not be

                        benefits; and (vi) you are not eligible to recover contributor's compensation benefits in the
                        event of injury. As a Merchant, you will not engage a Customer in any way that may jeopardize
                        your status as an independent contractor.</p>
                    
                    <p>Dishefs will make available to Gofers, Dishefs-logoed t-shirts, accessories, bags and other

                        represent themselves as an employee or agent of Dishefs or any Merchant, and will make no
                        statements purporting to bind or commit Dishefs or any Merchant to any conditions or

                        employer provides such logoed merchandise, these same terms apply.</p>

                        designated delivery address, and/or the location of the Merchant. Customers are

                        taxes. Dishefs will remit to Merchant the total Price collected for all Items Merchant

                        completed through the Dishefs App, Merchant will pay Dishefs a percentage commission of the Meal
                        purchased (excluding any Sales Tax collected on Merchant's behalf) multiplied by the applicable
                        fee percentage for the Sales Channel used to sell each such Item ("Fee"). The Fee does not
                        include any applicable taxes. Dishefs will remit to Merchant the total cost of the meal

                        to a Dine-In Match-Up Customer's choice. Dine-In Match-Up Customer will pay a small fee to
                        Dishefs to be matched to a potential Restaurant Merchant. These profiles will include how
                        many days or hours in advance a reservation or wait-listing can be requested and what the
                        Restaurant Merchant's policy is on No-Shows or last minute (with a set number of hours or

                    <p>Dishefs Services connect you with Customers who wish to purchase your Items or Services. You are
                        the "merchant," "retailer," or "seller" of all Items or Services to be made available for sale
                        via the Dishefs App using Marketplace or Match-Up Channels. As such, you are responsible
                        for determining and setting the price for each Item or Service (the "Price"). The term
                        "Sales Tax" includes any sales, sellers use, transaction privilege, privilege, general excise,
                        gross receipts, and similar transaction taxes, as well as any bottle, bag, plastic, or other
                        similar fees. For the sake of clarity, the Price for each Item or Service excludes separately
                        stated Sales Taxes. Merchant hereby authorizes Dishefs to collect applicable Sales Taxes
                        on Merchant's behalf based on information provided by Merchant through the Dishefs Tools. The
                        Dishefs Tools' functionality may be based on interpretations of federal, state, and local laws
                        and regulations and information provided by taxing authorities. Merchant's use of the Dishefs
                        Tools, including any communications with Dishefs, in no way constitutes the provision of legal
                        or tax advice.Merchant shall promptly notify Dishefs if it believes any charges (or lack
                        of charges) for Sales Taxes were erroneous or inaccurate. If Sales Taxes charged by Merchant are
                        not in accordance with (or in violation of) any law or regulation, Dishefs expressly reserves
                        the right to, upon prior notice to Merchant, remove affected Items or Services from Merchant's
                        menu or offerings on the Dishefs App and/or deactivate Merchant from the Dishefs App.
                        Legislation commonly known as "marketplace facilitator" laws ("Marketplace Facilitator Laws")
                        requires Dishefs to collect and remit Sales Taxes directly to the taxing authority.
                        Dishefs will determine the amount of applicable Sales Tax which Dishefs will collect and remit
                        to the taxing authority based on Item or Service descriptions and Additional Information
                        provided by Merchant.</p>
                    
                    <p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.3, Merchant may not make any Item or
                        Service available to Customers through the Dishefs App at a price that is higher than the price
                        that Merchant charges in-store or through other sales avenues for similar Items or Services.
                        Merchant agrees that you will not make an Item or Service available under this Agreement at a
                        price higher than the amount Merchant is charging for similar Items or Services through any
                        comparable platform for the Items or Services offered.</p>
                    
                    <p>As it is Merchant's responsibility to keep pricing displayed on the Dishefs app current, any
                        discrepancy in the prices made available to the customer through the Dishefs App and Merchant's
                        current pricing for Items ordered shall be borne solely by Merchant.</p>
                    
                    <p>5.4Packaging</p>
                    
                    <p>Merchants may choose to purchase packaging materials and/or labels from us for the delivery of
                        Items to Customers. If purchased, we may charge your credit card or other acceptable
                        payment method you provide.</p>
                    
                    <p>5.5Appointment of Limited Payment Collection Agent</p>
                    
                    <p>Merchant is solely responsible for providing Dishefs with, and maintaining, accurate bank account
                        information. Merchant hereby appoints Dishefs and its affiliates, as the case may be, as
                        Merchant's limited payment collection agent solely for the purpose of:</p>
                    
                    <ol>
                        <li>accepting payment of the Price of Items sold or Services provided by Merchant via the
                            Dishefs App plus any applicable Sales Tax collected on Merchant's behalf, via the payment
                            processing functionality facilitated by the Dishefs Tools; and</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <ol>
                        <li>remitting the Price collected on Merchant's behalf less the retained Fee and, if applicable,
                            any refunds given to Customers on behalf of Merchant ("Revenue," as defined above).
                            Further, Merchant agrees that payment collected on its behalf by Dishefs or its affiliates
                            will be considered the same as payment made directly to Merchant. Merchant agrees that
                            if Merchant does not receive payment from Dishefs or its affiliates, Merchant's only
                            recourse will be against Dishefs and its affiliates. Dishefs and its affiliates may, from
                            time to time, request information from Merchant to confirm Merchant's identity as may be
                            necessary under any applicable compliance obligations before remitting any amounts to
                            Merchant and may refuse to process amounts owed to Merchant if there exists a legal or
                            regulatory risk or potential breach of law or regulation associated with such remittance to
                            Merchant. Merchant agrees that Dishefs and its affiliates may describe or otherwise
                            reflect the terms of this Section, and any related portions of the applicable addendum or
                            this Agreement, in any terms of use, receipts, disclosures, or notices that may be deemed
                            necessary or prudent. If reasonable, Dishefs may adjust the remittance of Revenue collected
                            on Merchant's behalf for reasons including failure to fulfill an Item as ordered, making a
                            correction on an Item, or failing to provide a Service, or not providing a Service as agreed
                            upon. Merchant may identify any disagreements in connection with such adjustments
                            through the Dishefs Tools. Dishefs and its affiliates reserve the right to collect any
                            amounts in connection with such adjustments via a deduction from the remittance of Revenue
                            collected on Merchant's behalf, by debiting the payment method or Merchant's bank account on
                            record, or otherwise seeking reimbursement from Merchant by any lawful collection methods
                            available. Merchant authorizes Dishefs and its affiliates to use any or all of the above
                            methods to seek such adjustments and reimbursements. In more serious situations, such as
                            fraud (including any charges for Items or Services that Customers did not place) or Customer
                            complaints, Dishefs and its affiliates reserve the right to cancel a payment entirely. By
                            agreeing to these terms, Merchant gives Dishefs and its affiliates express consent to adjust
                            payments collected on Merchant's behalf as set forth in this Section.</li>

                    <p>Subscriptions: Customers may pay for Items or Services using credit cards or other payment
                        methods as may be determined by Dishefs from time to time. Merchants will be prompted to provide
                        bank account details to us so that we may facilitate transfer of payments received from
                        Customers purchasing Items or Services. If you submit your payment information through the
                        Service, then you authorize Dishefs to store that payment information and charge your payment
                        method for any Item or Service you purchase. You will promptly update your account information
                        with any changes (for example, a change in your billing address or credit card expiration date)
                        that may occur.</p>
                    
                    <p>If you purchase Marketplace or Match-Up Services on a recurring or subscription basis, you hereby
                        authorize Dishefs to bill your payment instrument in advance on a periodic basis in accordance
                        with the terms of any particular subscription order until you terminate or pause such order or
                        terminate your account. Recurring or subscription-based purchases can only be terminated
                        on 30 (thirty) days' notice to Dishefs. You further agree to pay any charges so incurred.
                        If you dispute any charges you must let Dishefs know within fourteen (14) days after the date
                        that Dishefs charges you.</p>
                    
                    <p>5.7Fee Modifications</p>
                    
                    <p>We reserve the right to change or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, some or all of the
                        fees for the Dishefs Service. Any change will be effective upon posting of a revised Fee
                        Policy. Your continued use of the Service after the fee change becomes effective
                        constitutes your agreement to pay the changed amount.</p>

                    <p>Dishefs may, from time to time, require Merchant to provide certain additional information
                        ("Additional Information") pertaining to particular Items, particular sales of Items, or
                        descriptions of Services, for the proper determination, calculation, collection, and remittance
                        of Sales Taxes, or to comply with other applicable laws or regulations, or to provide Merchant
                        with information services. Additional Information may include, but is not limited to: Universal
                        Product Codes ("UPCs"), Global Trade Item Numbers ("GTINs"), Stock Keeping Units ("SKUs"),
                        ingredients, temperature, container, weight, volume, quantities, serving/portion size,
                        nutritional facts, CO2 waste value, expiration date, inclusion of utensils, method of
                        preparation (e.g., sliced), identity of preparer, whether the item is "ready-to-eat," the items
                        intended use, equipment available, hours of availability, etc. Merchant is solely responsible
                        for providing requested Additional Information to Dishefs in a timely manner. If Merchant fails
                        to timely provide Additional Information in response to notification and request by Dishefs,
                        Dishefs expressly reserves the right to temporarily remove affected Items or Services from
                        Merchant's menu of Items or Services on the Dishefs App until such Additional Information is
                        received.</p>

                        Android Market or other distribution channels ("Software Distribution Channels"). If you obtain

                    <p>Dishefs may provide Merchant aggregate information regarding the number of Items picked up by
                        Merchant-Drivers, Gofers, or 3rd Party Drivers, Items or Services sold by Merchant to Customers,
                        and information regarding number of dine-in transactions. Dishefs will also provide
                        reasonable information regarding any refunds given to Customers, including the date of the
                        transaction, the Item ordered, or Service provided, the reason for the refund and any other

                        parent company or Franchisor.</p>

                    <p>Subject to this Agreement, each party hereby grants to the other party (and, in the case of
                        Dishefs, to its affiliates) a limited, non-exclusive and non-transferable license during the
                        Term to use such party's respective Marks in the territory, on a royalty-free basis, in
                        connection with the activities related to this Agreement or any other activities relating to the
                        Dishefs Services. For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Marks" will mean the trademarks,
                        service marks, trade names, copyrights, logos, slogans, content, media, materials, identifying
                        symbols and indicia of the applicable party. All uses of a party's Marks by the other party will
                        be in the form and format specified or approved by the owner of such Marks. Other than as
                        specifically set forth in this Agreement, neither party will use the other party's Marks without
                        the prior, express, written consent of the other party (by email is sufficient). For the
                        avoidance of doubt, however, any use or display of Merchant's Marks by Dishefs or its affiliates
                        in connection with making Items available through the Dishefs App in the ordinary course of
                        business will not require any such prior, express, written consent. Merchant further agrees that
                        any use or display of Dishefs' Marks will conform to the current version of Dishefs Brand
                        Guidelines. All goodwill related to the use of a party's Marks by the other party will inure to
                        the benefit of the owner of such Marks. Except as expressly set forth herein, neither party will
                        be deemed to grant the other party any license or rights under any intellectual property or
                        other proprietary rights. All rights not granted are expressly reserved.</p>
                    
                    <p>Without limiting anything in the Agreement, Merchant represents and warrants that Merchant's
                        Marks do not infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate any third party's intellectual
                        property or other proprietary rights. Merchant agrees that Dishefs or its affiliates may remove
                        Merchant's Marks from the Dishefs App if Dishefs or its affiliates receive notice or otherwise
