                        <hr>
                    </div>
                    <p>This Privacy Policy explains Dishefs (“Dishefs'” or “we” or “our”) privacy practices for
                        visitors to our proprietary website at www.dishefs.com and any of our associated Applications on
                        any device. Any Dishefs platform you access is referred to in this Privacy Policy as the "Site."
                        We created this Privacy Policy to explain what information we gather from you when you visit our
                        Site and how we may use and disclose this information. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into
                        and made a part of Dishef’s Terms of Use and other agreements that refer to the Privacy Policy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This document has been compiled to help you understand how your personal information, as
                        described in U.S. privacy law and information security, can be used. Please read this Privacy
                        Policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how Dishefs collects, uses, protects or
                        otherwise handles your information in accordance with our Site, and your options regarding our
                        collection of that information.</p>
                    <p>

                        By using our Site, you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal
                        information as described in this Privacy Policy. We reserve the right to change this Privacy
                        Policy at any time. If we make any material changes to our Privacy Policy, we will post a new
                        policy on the Site and update the “last updated” date set forth above. Policy changes will apply
                        only to information collected after the date of the change. By your continued use of the Site
                        after an update, you consent to any and all changes.</p>
                    <p>

                        This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected through our Site and not to
                        information collected offline.</p>

                    <h5>Information Collected</h5>

                    <p>

                        We use IP addresses and session identifiers such as web beacons, pixel tags, and other tracking
                        technologies to analyze trends, to administer the Site, to track user activities, to infer user
                        interests and to otherwise induce, deduce and gather information about individual users and
                        market segments. Like many websites, we use "cookies" to enhance your experience and gather
                        information about visitors and visits to our Site.</p>
                    <p>

                        how we use them, and how you can control the use of cookies in your browser.</p>

                    <h5>Use of Your Information</h5>

                    <p>We may use the information that we collect from you when you register to use the Site, purchase

                        <li>-To quickly process your transactions.</li>

                        <li>-To administer a promotion, survey or other feature of the Site.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h5>Disclosure of Information Collected to Third Parties</h5>

                    <p>We generally do not sell to, trade with or otherwise transfer to third parties your
                    personally
                    identifiable information unless we provide you with advance notice, except as described
                    herein.
                    The term "third parties" as used in this policy does not include website hosting partners
                    and
                    other parties who assist us in operating our Site, conducting our business, or servicing
                    you, so
                    long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. In the event that we sell
                    our
                    company, or otherwise transfer any assets of our company, we may provide your information to
                    the
                    purchaser so that you may continue the relationship or business with us and our products. We
                    may
                    also release your information when we believe that release is necessary to comply with the
                    law,
                    enforce the policies of our Site, or protect our or others' rights, property, or safety.</p>

                   <p> However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties
                    for
                    marketing, advertising, or other uses.</p>

                    <h5>Safeguarding Your Personal Information</h5>
                    <p>We follow generally accepted industry security standards to safeguard and help prevent
                    unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use personal identification and
                    financial information. However, no commercial method of information transfer over the
                    Internet
                    or electronic data storage is known to be 100% secure. As a result, we cannot guarantee the
                    absolute security of such information during its transmission or its storage in our systems,
                    and
                    you should always take care to safeguard your personal information.</p>

                   <h5> Third-Party Links</h5>

                    <p>This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by our Site. In an attempt to
                    provide you with increased value, we may include third-party links on our Site. These linked
                    websites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility
                    or
                    liability for the content and activities of these linked websites. Nonetheless, we seek to
                    protect the integrity of our Site and welcome any feedback about these linked websites
                    (including if a specific link does not work).</p>

                   <h5> COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h5>

                    <p>We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old and as such are not
                    required to collect age information before we collect other personal information. We
                    encourage
                    parents to implement controls when allowing children to access our Site.</p>

                    <p>As to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old,
                    the
                    Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade
                    Commission, the United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which
                    spells
                    out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and
                    safety online. You can learn more about COPPA at
                    https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-16/part-312.</p>

                    <h5>Data Breach</h5>
                    <p>In compliance with Fair Information Practices, we will take the following responsive action,
                    should a data breach occur:</p>
                    <p> We will notify you via email within seven (7) business days.</p>
                    <p>We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the
                    right
                    to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors and processors who fail to
                    adhere
                    to the law.</p>
                    <h5>CAN SPAM Act</h5>
                    <p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements
                    for
                    commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to
                    them,
                    and spells out tough penalties for violations.</p>

                    <p>We collect your email address in order to:</p>

                    <p>-Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions.</p>

                    <p>-Process orders and to send information and updates pertaining to orders.</p>

                    <p>-Send you additional information related to your product and/or service.</p>

                    <p>-Market to our mailing list or continue to send emails to our clients after the original
                    transaction has occurred.</p>

                    <h5>Questions</h5>

                    <p>We welcome your questions, comments, and concerns about our Privacy Policy. Please send us
                    any
